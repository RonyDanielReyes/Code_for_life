// If the number is greater than 10, print the number followed by ": All Systems Green.".
// If the number is between 6 and 10, print the number followed by ": Starting Ignition Sequence.".
// If the number is between 3 and 5, print the number followed by ": Ignition Complete.".
// If the number is between 1 and 2, print the number followed by ": Full Power.".
// If the number is equal to 0, print the number followed by ": Liftoff!" and then exit the program.
